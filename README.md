# TellTaleApp
A none official TellTale android app to check news/games of TellTale studio, with the ability to take a look at my games' saves/progress on android 😁.

## Why this app exists:
I've played some TellTale games (Batman, Batman Season two), and I like them, 
So I've wanted to show my friends my games saves/choices in an easy way, 
moreover I would like to practice more on creating mobile apps using react-native 😜  

## Is this app safe?
This app is using the offcial TellTate web api, and not saving any kind of information/data on third-party servers,
So YES, it's totaly safe.

## 📢 Disclamer:
Please Don't use this app for purchasing games/DLCs, instead use the official website (https://www.telltale.com/).
